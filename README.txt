This is an educational tool.

It lets you run voting polls on a set of pictures.

It does not have particularly high standards of security against issues such as 
vote-stuffing. Use for a real site at your own peril. The purpose is education.

It has an API, with which students learning HTML, CSS and basic JS can set up 
their own site using only a set of static files.
